# ACM ICPC PROBLEMS/SOLUTIONS

This project is just a project created to have fun designing solutions for ICPC problems.

## Getting Started

The solutions purposed here were not designed to be the smallest solution in number of characters, as we know that there are techniques to reduce the size of the file. However, they were designed to be the clearest as possible.
